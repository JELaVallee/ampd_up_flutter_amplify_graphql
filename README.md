## 1. Setting The Stage: The Bare-bones ToDo App
### 1.1. Overview of the Boring ToDo Flutter App
This demo starts out with a bare-bones, boring as dirt "ToDo App" written in Flutter.

It has the minimum Create/Read/Update/Delete functionality but, sadly, is currently not connected to any backing services.

### 1.2. Demo the Boring ToDo Flutter App
Before we get this jam session rolling, you can run the bare-bones app by running:

```
$ flutter run -d {device-name}
```

### 1.3. Next Step...
1. Checkout the branch `02-amplify-init`
2. Open the README.md in that branch at [2. Configure: Initialize Amplify](https://github.com/JELaVallee/ampd_up_flutter_amplify_graphql/blob/02-amplify-init/README.md#2-configure-initialize-amplify)
